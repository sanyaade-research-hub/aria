/*
  This is an example of how to use the limiting actions.

  It requires a SICK laser. Use either a joystick or keyboard
  to drive the robot.  If the SICK laser detects obstacles, actions
  slow down the robot as it approaches.
  
  The way it works is that it has a limiting behavior higher priority
  than the joydrive and keydrive actions.  So if the limiting behaviors
  detect obstacles that are too close, they set speed limits proportional 
  to the distance that slow down the robot and eventually prevent the 
  joydrive and keydrive actions from having any effect on the robot.
